* footnotes

Inline [fn::footnote] footnote.

Anchor [fn:x] footnote.

Inline anchor [fn:y:Because we are going to reference this somewhere else.] footnote.

Somewhere else [fn:y].

[fn:x] Definition

** here we go

Inline nested [fn::And now we have another footnote in here [fn::Nested.]]

Inline nested two [fn::
 this is actually allowed [fn::and this is a footnote inside a footnote 
 however the nesting behavior results in nested footnotes being rendered first
 for some very strange reason, that might be a bug actually
 ]
 because the contents are just paragraphs]

Inline nested three [fn::
 not footnote due to block [fn::however this inner footnote does work
 ] this does not work
    #+begin_src bash
    echo per the spec blocks can only go in non-inline footnotes
    #+end_src
 oof]

Inline drawer should fail [fn::
:hello:
this should not be an inline footnote I think?
:end:
] and thankfully does because drawers are not valid parts of paragraphs.

Inline multiple spaces [fn::Paragraph thing


Hrm.


Sigh


] should still be part of the original paragraph?

HAHAH YES. IT IS NOT!
Despite the fact that the font locking regex shows that it is.

A [fn::B
C] D. Yes.

E [fn::F

G] H. No.

I [fn::J


K] L. No.

Wat [fn:q].

Intervening.

The following is NOT a footnote anchor [fn:con].
 [fn:con] confusingly.

Testing [fn:no-space].

What?!?!?!?! [fn:: [ hello =]= there
another p]

Unmatched [fn:: [ lol]

[fn:q] Hello there
#+begin_src bash
echo this works for html but not for pdf or latex? A regression I think?
echo no, you must have #+latex_header: \usepackage{bigfoot} for this

#+end_src

:also:

[fn:con]

We have to have a real working =[fn:con]= definition otherwise org will not export.
You can't set =#+options: broken-footnotes:t= like you can with =#+options: broken-links:t=.

[fn:no-space]These don't require a space actually.
